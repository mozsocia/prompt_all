Generate the new code now, for code part start with the "File: [path]" line exactly as in the example, followed by the code block wraped by triple backticks with the  language identifier

---

Generate the new code now, adhering exactly to this structure for each code part: Start with the line "File: [path]" precisely as shown (replacing [path] with the actual file path), immediately followed by the code block wrapped in triple backticks with the language identifier (e.g., ```python). End after the closing triple backticks. Repeat this for multiple files if needed, with no other text in between or after. Violation of this format is not permitted.

Generate the code, strictly adhering to the following format for each file:
Start with a newline, followed by the line "File: [path]" (replacing [path] with the actual file path) on its own line. Then in next line  include the code block wrapped in triple backticks with the appropriate language identifier (e.g., ```python), followed by a newline. The code block must be complete and functional. End the file section with the closing triple backticks, followed by a newline. For multiple files, repeat this exact structure for each file. Do not deviate from this format under any circumstances.
