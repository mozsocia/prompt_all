Generate the new code now, adhering exactly to this structure for each code part: Start with the line "File: [path]" precisely as shown (replacing [path] with the actual file path), immediately followed by the code block wrapped in triple backticks with the language identifier (e.g., ```python). End after the closing triple backticks. Repeat this for multiple files if needed, with no other text in between or after. Violation of this format is not permitted.
