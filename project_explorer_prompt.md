Generate the new code now, for code part start with the "File: [path]" line exactly as in the example, followed by the code block wraped by triple backticks with the  language identifier

---

Generate the new code now, adhering exactly to this structure for each code part: Start with the line "File: [path]" precisely as shown (replacing [path] with the actual file path), immediately followed by the code block wrapped in triple backticks with the language identifier (e.g., ```python). End after the closing triple backticks. Repeat this for multiple files if needed, with no other text in between or after. Violation of this format is not permitted.

Generate the new code now, adhering exactly to this structure for each code part: Start with the line "File: [path]" precisely as shown (replacing [path] with the actual file path) on its own line, followed by a newline, then the code block wrapped in triple backticks with the language identifier (e.g., ```python). End after the closing triple backticks, followed by a newline if there is another file. Repeat this for multiple files if needed, ensuring a newline separates the closing triple backticks of one file from the "File: [path]" line of the next, Violation of this format is not permitted.
