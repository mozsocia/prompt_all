Here's a much better, clearer, and more effective prompt you can add (or replace your current one with) when asking an LLM to implement or refactor code:

```
Refactor the implementation to be as concise, clean, and minimal as possible while fully preserving all functionality, correctness, and readability. 

Prioritize:
- Removing any redundant, duplicated, or unnecessary code
- Using built-in language features, idiomatic patterns, and concise syntax where appropriate
- Keeping the code easy for a human developer to understand and maintain
- Avoiding over-engineering or adding new abstractions unless they significantly reduce complexity

Aim for the shortest possible implementation that remains clear and professional. Do not add new features, comments, or explanations unless they improve clarity.
```

### Alternative shorter version (if you want something more direct):

```
Make the code significantly shorter and cleaner without changing its behavior. Eliminate redundancy, leverage language idioms, and keep it highly readable for humans. Use the minimal amount of code necessary.
```

### Even more precise version (great for follow-ups):

```
Rewrite this implementation to be minimal and elegant: reduce lines of code as much as possible while keeping it fully functional, correct, and easy to understand. Prefer concise, idiomatic solutions over verbose ones.
```
