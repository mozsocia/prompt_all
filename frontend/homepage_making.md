For office:
- First create header footer with only home page every section  names in center of the every  section 
- then make header footer dynamic then go the slider section design then make slider dynamic 
- this way part by part design then dynamic 
- in daily work note also attach commit history and link of commits

For Real Me: 
- first make home page static using sonnet 4
- give opus/sonnet the static page with model to build a  scratch model 
- after scratch model build now refine the model with snake case name by section to avoid too much nested structures 
- after creating router and controller tell AI to create the edit and detail page 
- edit and detail page must be tabed
- this model is too large so create detail and edit page separately 
- in edit page image preview is not going to work for tabed section, so use non tab section for image
